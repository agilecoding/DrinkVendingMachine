Behavior Driven Development demo using Drink Vending Machine Software

BDD Steps:

1.	Create a feature file with failing scenario (feature file, non implemented step definition class) -Red
2.	Create a failing unit test (TDD cycle starts)  -Red
3.	Write Minimum code to pass the unit test  -Green
4.	Refactor the code base – Yellow
5.	Re-run the unit Test and see it pass -Green
6.	Write the minimum Glue code to implement the Step definition class to pass the feature file -Green
7.	Refactor the feature file, Step Definitions, Glue Code –Yellow
8.	Re-run the feature file and see everything pass - Green

Note: Project was comitted in stages corresponding to Steps 1 - 8
